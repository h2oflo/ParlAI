Decided to host the website statically on S3. Was not a hundred percent sure if that was what was requested, but
  figured that's what was wanted as the requested name of this file was *FRONTEND*.

In terms of bring up the resources required, chose to write up a terraform module that would create a bucket
  with a randomly generated string at the end to ensure unique name of bucket. Also configured the bucket to 
  spin up with public access already allowed to ensure we could access resources within the bucket when we deploy
  the project to the bucket and instructed it to expect index.html as the index doc with error.html as the error doc.

In terms of building a deploying, I added the configs to ./github/workflows/main.yml. I'm unfortunately not too familiar with Gitlab
  Actions and thus had to learn this one on the fly. Unfortunately, I also didn't have access to any runners to
  test out my configs and testing it was taking 27+ minutes to queue up on a runner github provides, so did my best
  with what I could read online with the configuration.

For the github workflow, I opted to use a build/deploy flow. This setup would pull down the entire project, build it,
  then deploy the directory and only the directory into the s3 bucket. Fleshing this out to different job stages allows us
  to be able to reuse the artifact build, say if we wanted to deploy this to different locations instead of just to a 
  single S3 bucket, we could build to artifact and use it within several different stages if need be.
  This separation also makes it easier to maintain different parts of the pipeline. In the case that a part of the pipeline
  fails, we could also just rerun that individual job without having to rerun the entire thing.
